      <h3>GENERAL:</h3>
      <ol class="decimal">
        <li>To participate with submitting content and/or downloading content on the Qlik Branch site, users will need to be
          registered as a Qlik Branch participant. Qlik reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time, to reject
          or remove participants, without notice or liability.</li>
        <li>All submissions of Qlik Branch Projects made to Qlik Branch and all use and distribution of “Qlik Branch Projects”
          downloaded from Qlik Branch (or through a link on Qlik Branch) are made in accordance with the Apache 2.0 open
          source license which is available at <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.”" target="_blank">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.”</a></li>
        <li>Although Qlik Branch Projects and other content are made available on a Qlik website, Qlik is not the developer,
          owner or representative for the Qlik Branch Projects or other submitted content, unless specifically stated to
          the contrary. Qlik retains the right to reject any submissions and to edit or remove accepted submissions, at any
          time in their sole discretion, and without notice or liability. Qlik will reject submissions which do not comply
          with these Terms of Use. Qlik Branch Projects may be made available on Qlik Branch by a direct link on Qlik Branch,
          by a reference link to another site or by other similar means, in Qlik’s sole discretion.</li>
        <li>QLIK DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, ENDORSEMENTS, OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THE QLIK BRANCH SITE OR
          ANY SUBMITTED CONTENT, AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS, ENDORSEMENTS, AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING BUT
          NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ABSENCE OR ERRORS,
          COMPATABILITY, QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. QLIK ESPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE QLIK BRANCH
          SITE AND ALL SUBMITTED CONTENT, AND ACCORDINGLY, SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY CLAIMS,
          LOSSES OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR DATA, OR ANY SPECIAL, PUNATIVE, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
          DAMAGES, RELATING TO USER’S USE OF THE QLIK BRANCH SITE, OR ANY CONTENT POSTED THEREON OR ACCESSED THEREWITH.</li>
        <li style="">Qlik Branch allows the posting of reviews of Qlik Branch Projects, and comments on such reviews, as well as networking
          with other Qlik Branch participants. These postings will include identifying information with respect to the posts,
          including the submitter’s name, which may be viewed by other users of the QlikCommunity and Qlik Branch. If the
          submitter or Qlik Branch participant does not want his/her name or associate post information to appear with any
          postings, they should not post on Qlik Branch. To be useful to other users, all posts must be made in good faith
          after reasonable evaluation of the Qlik Branch Project. Only one post can be made per Qlik Branch Project, unless
          a later review reflects a good faith change based upon further evaluation. Affiliations (whether as a supporter
          or competitor) with a Qlik Branch Project (or the contributor thereof) must be disclosed.</li>
        <li style="">Participants should not submit content which:
          <ul>
            <li>they do not wish to be shared with other Qlik Branch participants.</li>
            <li>is inconsistent with the purpose of Qlik Branch;</li>
            <li>is unrelated to a Qlik Branch Project – for example, discussing Qlik, its employees, business or stock, or those
              of other companies, or unrelated products or services;</li>
            <li>is harmful, threatening, abusive, insulting, harassing, defamatory, libelous, profane, sexually explicit, obscene,
              or otherwise offensive or objectionable;</li>
            <li>is false, fraudulent or misleading;</li>
            <li>violates applicable law, including any privacy, intellectual property or other rights of others, or which suggests
              or encourages unlawful activity;</li>
            <li>constitutes advertising or any other form of commercial solicitation; or</li>
            <li>impersonates any other person or entity, including Qlik employees.</li>
          </ul>
          Posting of hypertext links to third-party sites is discouraged, unless they are relevant to the review (for example, a link
          to a publication containing a review of the relevant Qlik Branch Project).</li>
        <li>The submitters/copyright holders for content submitted to Qlik Branch expressly grant to Qlik a perpetual, non-terminable,
          worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, right and license to use, reproduce, distribute,
          modify, and display the submitted content, or any portion thereof, in any medium, (i) to market, test, promote
          and otherwise engage in commercial activities consistent with presenting such content on Qlik Branch, and making
          such content available to users of QlikView®; (ii) to use the names, trademarks, service marks, logos and trade
          names associated with the content as part of presenting and providing such content; and (iii) authorize users of
          Qlik Branch to access, display, download, reproduce, distribute and otherwise use the content.</li>
        <li>Qlik reserves the right directly, or acting through agents or third parties, to investigate any violation of these
          terms and take appropriate remedial action. QlikTech may enforce these terms by any legal means, including, but
          not limited to, warning participants of violations; disabling or suspending privileges and/or access; removing,
          blocking or editing any content; or prohibiting any behavior that does not comply with these terms, or which is
          otherwise inappropriate, harmful, or objectionable. Qlik may release information concerning the use of Qlik Branch
          (including records and published content) when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g.,
          pursuant to a subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply these terms; to protect our rights or property;
          to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of Qlik Branch; or if Qlik reasonably believes that a situation
          involving imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury to any person requires disclosure. Deliberate attempts
          to evade or circumvent the suspension or termination of access or use of Qlik Branch, or otherwise violate these
          terms, may result in legal action. To report violations of these terms, please email <a href="mailto:branchadmin@qlik.com">branchadmin@qlik.com</a>          with appropriate details, including your contact information.</li>
